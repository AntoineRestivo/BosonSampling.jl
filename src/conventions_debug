Here are notes about debugging the conventions

I think that conventions of Tichy are actually counter intuitive:

don't you think Tichy's convention, our Eq. 1, is counter intuitive? It means multiplying states by the left, right ? So the actual interferometer matrix corresponds to the transpose of what we would "naturally" write, do you agree?

To fix this, we need to transpose every matrix before feeding it to the probability computations

This is not very convenient, as especially the order of multiplication is reversed as well

Maybe I could leave the things as conventional, and only then transpose at the moment of computing stuff.
